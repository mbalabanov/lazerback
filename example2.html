          <p>
            Once upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had one
            daughter, and she was courted by a gentleman. Every evening he used
            to come and see her, and stop to supper at the farmhouse, and the
            daughter used to be sent down into the cellar to draw the beer for
            supper. So one evening she had gone down to draw the beer, and she
            happened to look up at the ceiling while she was drawing, and she
            saw a mallet stuck in one of the beams. It must have been there a
            long, long time, but somehow or other she had never noticed it
            before, and she began a-thinking. And she thought it was very
            dangerous to have that mallet there, for she said to herself:
            "Suppose him and me was to be married, and we was to have a son, and
            he was to grow up to be a man, and come down into the cellar to draw
            the beer, like as I'm doing now, and the mallet was to fall on his
            head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!" And she put
            down the candle and the jug, and sat herself down and began
            a-crying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long
            drawing the beer, and her mother went down to see after her, and she
            found her sitting on the settle crying, and the beer running over
            the floor. "Why, whatever is the matter?" said her mother. "Oh,
            mother!" says she, "look at that horrid mallet! Suppose we was to be
            married, and was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to
            come down to the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall
            on his head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!" "Dear,
            dear! what a dreadful thing it would be!" said the mother, and she
            sat her down aside of the daughter and started a-crying too. Then
            after a bit the father began to wonder that they didn't come back,
            and he went down into the cellar to look after them himself, and
            there they two sat a-crying, and the beer running all over the
            floor. "Whatever is the matter?" says he. "Why," says the mother,
            "look at that horrid mallet. Just suppose, if our daughter and her
            sweetheart was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to
            grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer, and
            the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a dreadful
            thing it would be!" "Dear, dear, dear! so it would!" said the
            father, and he sat himself down aside of the other two, and started
            a-crying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by
            himself, and at last he went down into the cellar too, to see what
            they were after; and there they three sat a-crying side by side, and
            the beer running all over the floor. And he ran straight and turned
            the tap. Then he said: "Whatever are you three doing, sitting there
            crying, and letting the beer run all over the floor?"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh!" says the father, "look at that horrid mallet! Suppose you and
            our daughter was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to
            grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer, and
            the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him!" And then they all
            started a-crying worse than before. But the gentleman burst out
            a-laughing, and reached up and pulled out the mallet, and then he
            said: "I've travelled many miles, and I never met three such big
            sillies as you three before; and now I shall start out on my travels
            again, and when I can find three bigger sillies than you three, then
            I'll come back and marry your daughter." So he wished them good-bye,
            and started off on his travels, and left them all crying because the
            girl had lost her sweetheart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, he set out, and he travelled a long way, and at last he came
            to a woman's cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. And
            the woman was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass,
            and the poor thing durst not go. So the gentleman asked the woman
            what she was doing. "Why, lookye," she said, "look at all that
            beautiful grass. I'm going to get the cow on to the roof to eat it.
            She'll be quite safe, for I shall tie a string round her neck, and
            pass it down the chimney, and tie it to my wrist as I go about the
            house, so she can't fall off without my knowing it." "Oh, you poor
            silly!" said the gentleman, "you should cut the grass and throw it
            down to the cow!" But the woman thought it was easier to get the cow
            up the ladder than to get the grass down, so she pushed her and
            coaxed her and got her up, and tied a string round her neck, and
            passed it down the chimney, and fastened it to her own wrist. And
            the gentleman went on his way, but he hadn't gone far when the cow
            tumbled off the roof, and hung by the string tied round her neck,
            and it strangled her. And the weight of the cow tied to her wrist
            pulled the woman up the chimney, and she stuck fast half-way and was
            smothered in the soot.
          </p>
          <p>Well, that was one big silly.</p>
          <p>
            And the gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to stop the
            night, and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in
            a double-bedded room, and another traveller was to sleep in the
            other bed. The other man was a very pleasant fellow, and they got
            very friendly together; but in the morning, when they were both
            getting up, the gentleman was surprised to see the other hang his
            trousers on the knobs of the chest of drawers and run across the
            room and try to jump into them, and he tried over and over again,
            and couldn't manage it; and the gentleman wondered whatever he was
            doing it for. At last he stopped and wiped his face with his
            handkerchief. "Oh dear," he says, "I do think trousers are the most
            awkwardest kind of clothes that ever were. I can't think who could
            have invented such things. It takes me the best part of an hour to
            get into mine every morning, and I get so hot! How do you manage
            yours?" So the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and showed him how to
            put them on; and he was very much obliged to him, and said he never
            should have thought of doing it that way.
          </p>
          <p>So that was another big silly.</p>
          <p>
            Then the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came to a
            village, and outside the village there was a pond, and round the
            pond was a crowd of people. And they had got rakes, and brooms, and
            pitchforks, reaching into the pond; and the gentleman asked what was
            the matter. "Why," they say, "matter enough! Moon's tumbled into the
            pond, and we can't rake her out anyhow!" So the gentleman burst out
            a-laughing, and told them to look up into the sky, and that it was
            only the shadow in the water. But they wouldn't listen to him, and
            abused him shamefully, and he got away as quick as he could.
          </p>
          <p>
            So there was a whole lot of sillies bigger than them three sillies
            at home. So the gentleman turned back home again and married the
            farmer's daughter, and if they didn't live happy for ever after,
            that's nothing to do with you or me.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>THE ROSE-TREE</p>
          <p>
            There was once upon a time a good man who had two children: a girl
            by a first wife, and a boy by the second. The girl was as white as
            milk, and her lips were like cherries. Her hair was like golden
            silk, and it hung to the ground. Her brother loved her dearly, but
            her wicked stepmother hated her. "Child," said the stepmother one
            day, "go to the grocer's shop and buy me a pound of candles." She
            gave her the money; and the little girl went, bought the candles,
            and started on her return. There was a stile to cross. She put down
            the candles whilst she got over the stile. Up came a dog and ran off
            with the candles.
          </p>
          <p>
            She went back to the grocer's, and she got a second bunch. She came
            to the stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to climb over. Up
            came the dog and ran off with the candles.
          </p>
          <p>
            She went again to the grocer's, and she got a third bunch; and just
            the same happened. Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she
            had spent all the money and had lost three bunches of candles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stepmother was angry, but she pretended not to mind the loss.
            She said to the child: "Come, lay your head on my lap that I may
            comb your hair." So the little one laid her head in the woman's lap,
            who proceeded to comb the yellow silken hair. And when she combed
            the hair fell over her knees, and rolled right down to the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the stepmother hated her more for the beauty of her hair; so
            she said to her, "I cannot part your hair on my knee, fetch a billet
            of wood." So she fetched it. Then said the stepmother, "I cannot
            part your hair with a comb, fetch me an axe." So she fetched it.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Now," said the wicked woman, "lay your head down on the billet
            whilst I part your hair."
          </p>
          <p>
            Well! she laid down her little golden head without fear; and whist!
            down came the axe, and it was off. So the mother wiped the axe and
            laughed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then she took the heart and liver of the little girl, and she stewed
            them and brought them into the house for supper. The husband tasted
            them and shook his head. He said they tasted very strangely. She
            gave some to the little boy, but he would not eat. She tried to
            force him, but he refused, and ran out into the garden, and took up
            his little sister, and put her in a box, and buried the box under a
            rose-tree; and every day he went to the tree and wept, till his
            tears ran down on the box.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day the rose-tree flowered. It was spring, and there among the
            flowers was a white bird; and it sang, and sang, and sang like an
            angel out of heaven. Away it flew, and it went to a cobbler's shop,
            and perched itself on a tree hard by; and thus it sang,
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            "My wicked mother slew me, My dear father ate me, My little brother
            whom I love Sits below, and I sing above Stick, stock, stone dead."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Sing again that beautiful song," asked the shoemaker. "If you will
            first give me those little red shoes you are making." The cobbler
            gave the shoes, and the bird sang the song; then flew to a tree in
            front of a watchmaker's, and sang:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            "My wicked mother slew me, My dear father ate me, My little brother
            whom I love Sits below, and I sing above Stick, stock, stone dead."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh, the beautiful song! sing it again, sweet bird," asked the
            watchmaker. "If you will give me first that gold watch and chain in
            your hand." The jeweller gave the watch and chain. The bird took it
            in one foot, the shoes in the other, and, after having repeated the
            song, flew away to where three millers were picking a millstone. The
            bird perched on a tree and sang:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            "My wicked mother slew me, My dear father ate me, My little brother
            whom I love Sits below, and I sing above Stick!"
          </p>
          <p>
            Then one of the men put down his tool and looked up from his work,
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>"Stock!"</p>
          <p>Then the second miller's man laid aside his tool and looked up,</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>"Stone!"</p>
          <p>Then the third miller's man laid down his tool and looked up,</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>"Dead!"</p>
          <p>
            Then all three cried out with one voice: "Oh, what a beautiful song!
            Sing it, sweet bird, again." "If you will put the millstone round my
            neck," said the bird. The men did what the bird wanted and away to
            the tree it flew with the millstone round its neck, the red shoes in
            one foot, and the gold watch and chain in the other. It sang the
            song and then flew home. It rattled the millstone against the eaves
            of the house, and the stepmother said: "It thunders." Then the
            little boy ran out to see the thunder, and down dropped the red
            shoes at his feet. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the
            house once more, and the stepmother said again: "It thunders." Then
            the father ran out and down fell the chain about his neck.
          </p>
          <p>
            In ran father and son, laughing and saying, "See, what fine things
            the thunder has brought us!" Then the bird rattled the millstone
            against the eaves of the house a third time; and the stepmother
            said: "It thunders again, perhaps the thunder has brought something
            for me," and she ran out; but the moment she stepped outside the
            door, down fell the millstone on her head; and so she died.
